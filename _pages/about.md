# HI! I'M LAURENT
I currently work as a Data Engineer & Automations Specialist in Seychelles 🏖️🇸🇨

I graduated from Reading University in 2024 with a First Class Honours in Meteorology and Climate. Now I'm working on building AI infrastructure in Seychelles. My blog contains my thoughts on topics in Tech, Machine Learning and Mathematics.
